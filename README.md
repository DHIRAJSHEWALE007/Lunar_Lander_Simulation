# Lunar Lander Simulation using Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This project simulates a lunar lander using **reinforcement learning** techniques. The aim is to develop an agent that learns to land a spacecraft safely on the moon using minimal fuel and avoiding crashes.

The environment for this project is based on the popular **OpenAI Gym** `LunarLander-v2` environment, where the agent is trained using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning** with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Environment: OpenAI Gym's `LunarLander-v2`
- Trained model for testing

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (choose the framework you used)
- **OpenAI Gym**
- **NumPy**

##  Running the Project on Google Colab
To run this project, follow these steps:

### Steps to Run the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab:

1. Open Google Colab at [colab.research.google.com](colab.research.google.com). 

2. Upload the .ipynb file by **selecting File > Upload Notebook**.

3. Once the notebook is uploaded, Run the cells in the notebook to simulate the lunar lander environment and train the agent using reinforcement learning.
 
## Algorithm Details
This project uses **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate Q-values. The agent takes actions based on the Q-values, and the goal is to minimize the total negative reward by learning from experience (experience replay).

Key components of the DQN:
- **Replay Buffer**: Stores experiences to train the network.
- **Target Network**: Helps in stabilizing the learning process.

## Results
After training for approximately *650* episodes, the agent successfully lands the lunar module with high efficiency.


## Future Work
- Implement other reinforcement learning projects for better understanding of future trends.
- Add more complex environments for training, including obstacles or fuel constraints.
