#Lunar Lander Simulation using Reinforcement Learning
##Project Overview
This project simulates a lunar lander using reinforcement learning techniques. The aim is to develop an agent that learns to land a spacecraft safely on the moon using minimal fuel and avoiding crashes.

The environment for this project is based on the popular OpenAI Gym LunarLander-v2 environment, where the agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).
